title: Week 0!

For better or worse, many classes concentrate on theory (because you are all going to grad school right?).  While I certainly don't want to see UTCS become a trade school for programmers, I appreciate when a professor goes out of his way to prepare us for the real world.  

This brings me to Downing's Software Engineering class.  If you take Downing in the summer his first words to you are likely to be "why the hell aren't you in an internship??".  As students of Computer Science in a top University, we are blessed with ridiculous oportunity and Downing wants to make sure you take advantage of that.  In my previous major, paid internships were unheard of, so take Downings advice and get an internship!

Now for the meat of this blog.  What is it like to be in one of Downings classes?  I am only one week in so my opinion here is little more than an educated guess.  My overall feeling is that the class will be programming heavy and time consuming, but imminently useful.  So far we have been learnign some basic python and javascript frameworks and tools.  We covered assertions, unit tests and coverage.  The main focus seems to be on python, with a comparison of similar javascript tools thrown in for good measure.
