### Second Week
This was our first full week of class, and in class quizzes have started.  I felt that the first quiz was a little silly.  It asked question like what is the coverage tool we use?  It seemed like a silly question to me because once you get into the code you will know the names of your tools very well, so when I am reading documentation, I do not spend a lot of time memorizing tool names.  I feel that questions along the lines of: "What is the goal of project 0?", or "What is the collatz problem?" would be more appropriate quiz questions.

That said, the quizzes are not as bad as I thought they would be.  They are certainly not as hard as the in class algorithms or physics quizzes.  Also, I felt that the questions on quizzes 2 and 3 were much better.

One interesting thing that the professor does is call on random people in class.  He has some sort of randomized list and asks maybe 10-15 people questions per class.  This is a first for me at UT.  At first it is a bit nerve wracking, you dont want to look dumb in front of your peers, but I have gotten used to it.  Never knowing when you will be called on certainly keeps you alert in class though!

### Tip of the Week
As UT students we like to study hard and strengthen our minds, but dont forget to keep up with your body as well.  Take some time 3-5 times a week for the gym or your sport of choice.  Gregory gym is an awesome resource that is mostly free to us.
